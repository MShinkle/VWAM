# VWAM

This is the package we developed for **V**oxel-**W**eighted **A**ctivation **M**aximization. It includes utilities for extracting and downsampling DNN features and using these features to visualize selectivity in the brain. 

Check out this [brain viewer](http://piecesofmind.psyc.unr.edu/pycortex/activation_maximization/) for an example of the kinds of visualizations this can produce!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VWAM.git
cd VWAM
pip install -e .
```

## Demos

See our [demo walkthrough](demo/full_walkthrough.ipynb) for an example of how to use our code.
